\title{slidex: convert Microsoft PowerPoint slides to R Markdown}
\description{
This package is designed to extract information from Microsoft
PowerPoint slides, and then put that information into an R Markdown
document with a \href{xaringan}{https://github.com/yihui/xaringan} YAML. If
the xaringan package is also installed, beautiful html slides can then be
produced by knitting the RMD. At present, the package exports one function,
`convert_pptx`, which converts a .pptx file to R Markdown. The package is
not intended to be all encompassing or provide perfect conversion. Rather,
it should get you about 90% of the way there for about 80% of use cases.
Given the idiosyncrasies of different slide show presentations, it is
expected that some manual editing of the resulting RMD will need to be
completed to get the HTML slides to look exactly as you want them, but most
of the hard work should be done for you. Importantly, the package maintains
and provides the proper code for any images that were embedded in the .pptx
slides, as well as links. Tables are also generally maintained, although
they may require some manual editing if complex spanner heads and merged
cells were used in the original table. Nested bulleted lists should also be
maintained.
