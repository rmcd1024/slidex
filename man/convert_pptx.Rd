  path,
  author = NULL,
  title = NULL,

  date = Sys.Date(),

}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to the Microsoft PowerPoint file}

\item{author}{Optional string indicating the author or authors of the slide.
Defaults to the listed creator of the pptx.Multiple authors can be
provided with a string vector.}

\item{title}{Optional title of the slide deck. Defaults to the title of the
first slide in the deck.}

\item{sub}{Optional subtitle}

\item{date}{The date the slides were produced. Defaults to current date.}

\item{theme}{The css theme to apply to the xaringan slides. For options, see
\href{https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/tree/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/xaringan/resources}{here}.
Note that only the name of the theme needs to be applied
(e.g., \code{theme = "metropolis"}) and the proper code will be applied to
load both the theme and the fonts, although this can easily be manually
manipulated after conversion if you want other fonts with a specific theme.}

\item{highlightStyle}{The code highlighting style. Defaults to
\code{"github"} flavored highlighting}

\item{force}{If an 'assets' folder already exists in the current directory,
(e.g., from a previous conversion) should it be overwritten? Defaults to
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{writenotes}{Logical. If notes are in the original PPTX, should they be
written out as their own .txt file in addition to being embedded in the
slides? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{out_dir}{Optional output directory for the folder containing the RMD
and corresponding assets. Defaults to the current working directory.}

\item{output_format}{One of "xaringan" (default) or "latex". The latter changes file references from \code{.wmf} to \code{.png} and automatically converts \code{.wmf} files to \code{.png} files if you have libreoffice installed. In either case, file extensions in the output document are changed from \code{wmf} to \code{png}}
